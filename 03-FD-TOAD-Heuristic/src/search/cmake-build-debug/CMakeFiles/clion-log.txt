CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (message):
  Run cmake on the CMakeLists.txt in the 'src' directory, not the one in
  'src/search'.  Please delete CMakeCache.txt from the current directory and
  restart cmake.
